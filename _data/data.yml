career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My goals for the past couple years have revolved around learning how to
      securely transact value across the internet.
      This includes running nodes and understanding the different tradeoffs
      that different technologies make.
      I am mainly interested in open, public, borderless, persmisionless
      and censorship-resistant systems regardless of their nature.
